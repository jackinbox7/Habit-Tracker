Problem Statement

Many individuals struggle to build and maintain consistent daily habits. Without a simple tool to record progress, it becomes difficult to stay motivated and track improvements over time. This project addresses the need for a lightweight, accessible solution that helps users monitor their habits in a structured way.

Scope of the Project

The Habit Tracker project is designed as a command-line application built in Python. It focuses on core functionality such as adding habits, marking them as completed, and viewing progress. The scope is intentionally kept minimal to ensure ease of use and to serve as a foundation for future enhancements like persistence, streak tracking, and reminders.
